## 30. THE DOLPHINS, THE WHALES, AND THE SPRAT

The dolphins quarreled with the whales, and before very long they began fighting with one another. The battle was very fierce, and 
had lasted some time without andy sign of coming to an end, when a sprat thought that perhaps he could stop it; so he stepped in and 
tried to persuade them to give up fighting and make friends. But one of the dolphins said to him contemptuously, "We would rather go 
on fighting till we're all killed than be reconciled by a sprat like you!".

## 31. THE FOX AND THE MONKEY

A fox and a monkey were on the road together and fell into a dispute as to which of the two was the better born. They Kept it up for some time, till they came to a place where the road passed through a cemetery full of monuments, when when the monkey stopped and looked about him and gave a great sigh. "Why do you sigh?" said the fox. The monkey pointed to the tombs and  and replied, "All the monuments that you see here were put up in honor of my forefathers, who in their day were eminent men." The fox was speechless for a moment, but quickly recovering he said, "Oh! Don't stop at any lie, sir; you"re quite safe. I'm sure none of your ancestors will rise up and expose you."

Boasters brag most when they cannot be detected.

## 31. 狐狸和猴子

一只狐狸和一只猴子一起走在路上, 接着陷入一场有关谁出生更好的争论. 他们不停地争论一段时间, 直到他们走到了有路经过充满纪念碑的墓地的地方, 这时猴子停下来看了看狐狸, 发出一声长叹. "你为什么长叹", 狐狸说. 猴子指了指那些坟墓回复:"你看到的那些纪念碑都是纪念我的先祖, 他们活着的时候都是杰出的人.". 狐狸一时语塞, 但很快就清醒, 说:"哦! 谎言不要停, 先生, 你相当安全. 我确定你的先祖不会起身揭露你.".

吹牛者当他们不会被揭穿的时候吹嘘得最厉害.

## 32. THE ASS AND THE LAPDOG

There was once a man who had an ass and a lapdog. The ass was housed in the stable with plenty of oats and hay to eat and was as well
off as an ass could be. The little dog was made a great pet of by his master, who fondled him and often let him lie in his lap. And if
he went out to dinner, he would bring back a tidbit or two to give him when he ran to meet him on his return. The ass had, it is true,
a good deal of work to do, carting or grinding the corn, or carrying the burdens of the farm; and ere long he became very jealous, 
contrasting his own life of labor with the ease and idleness of the lapdog. At last one day he broke his halter, and frisking into the
house just as his master sat down to dinner, he pranced and capered about, mimicking the frolics of the little favorite, upsetting the
table and smashing the crockery with his clumsy efforts. Not content with that, he even tried to jump on his master's lap, as he had so
often seen the dog allowed to do. At that the servants, seeing the danger their master was in, belabored the silly ass with sticks and 
cudgels, and drove him back to his stable half dead with his beating. "Alas!" he cried. "All this I have brought on myself. Why could I 
not be satisfied with my natural and honorable position, without wishing to imitate the ridiculous antics of that useless little lapdog
?"

## 32. 驴和哈巴狗

曾经一个主人拥有一头驴和一条哈巴狗. 这头驴住在驴棚, 有大量的燕麦和干草吃, 作为一头驴已经很幸运了. 那条哈巴狗成为主人最爱的宠物, 主人抚摸它, 并常常
让它躺在他的大腿上. 如果主人外出吃饭, 会带回来一些美食, 当哈巴狗在他返回时跑过来欢迎他时给它. 当然, 这头驴有大量的工作要做, 拉车或研磨玉米, 或做农场的苦力活. 不久, 这头驴他的苦力生活和那头哈巴狗的轻松和无所事事对比, 变得十分嫉妒. 最后, 这头驴有一天挣脱了它的缰绳, 在它主人坐下来吃饭完的时候活蹦乱跳的跑进来, 它欢蹦雀乱跳, 模仿那条哈巴狗的嬉戏行为, 它那笨拙努力打翻了桌子和撞碎餐具. 那头驴并没有满足于此, 他甚至试图跳到主人的大腿上, 因为它经常看到那条哈巴狗可以这么做. 在那是, 仆人们看到主人有危险, 用棍棒毒打了这头蠢驴, 赶它回到它的驴棚, 这时这头驴已经被打得半死不活的.  "哎!", 它大哭道, "这一切都是我自己造成的. 为什么我不能满足于我自然和可敬的职位, 不去想模仿那条无用小狗的荒唐的行为?"

## 33. THE FIR TREE AND THE BRAMBLE
A fir tree was boasting to a bramble, and said, somewhat contemptuously, "You poor creature, you are of no use whatever. Now, look at 
me. I am useful for all sorts of things, particularly when men build houses; they can't do without me then." But the bramble replied, 
"Ah, that's all very well, but you wait till they come with axes and saws to cut you down, and then you'll wish you were a bramble and 
not a fir."
Better poverty without a care than wealth with its many obligations.

## 33. 冷杉与黑莓树
一颗冷杉树正向一颗黑莓树吹嘘, 口气有几分轻蔑, 说道:"你是个可怜的生物, 无论如何都没有用处. 现在, 看看我, 我对所有的东西都有用, 特别在人们要建设房子
的时候. 他们没我建不了". 但黑莓树回应说:"啊, 非常好, 但你等到他们带着斧子和锯子来把你砍倒时, 那时候你就希望你是一颗黑莓树而不是一颗冷杉."
没有忧虑的贫穷比有许多义务的富有要好.

## 39. THE FLEA AND THE MAN

A flea bit a man, and bit him again, and again, till he could stand it no longer, but made a thorough search for it, and at last 
succeeded in catching it. Holding it between his finger and thumb, he said--or rather shouted, so angry was he--"Who are you, pray, 
you wretched little creature, that you make so free with my person?" The flea, terrified, whimpered in a weak little voice, "Oh, sir! 
Pray let me go. Don't kill me! I am such a little thing that I can't do you much harm." But the man laughed and said, "I am going to 
kill you now, at once. Whatever is bad has got to be destroyed, no matter how slight the harm it does."

Do not waste you pity on a scamp.
