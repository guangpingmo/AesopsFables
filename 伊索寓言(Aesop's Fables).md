## 30. THE DOLPHINS, THE WHALES, AND THE SPRAT

The dolphins quarreled with the whales, and before very long they began fighting with one another. The battle was very fierce, and 
had lasted some time without andy sign of coming to an end, when a sprat thought that perhaps he could stop it; so he stepped in and 
tried to persuade them to give up fighting and make friends. But one of the dolphins said to him contemptuously, "We would rather go 
on fighting till we're all killed than be reconciled by a sprat like you!".

## 31. THE FOX AND THE MONKEY

A fox and a monkey were on the road together and fell into a dispute as to which of the two was the better born. They Kept it up for some time, till they came to a place where the road passed through a cemetery full of monuments, when when the monkey stopped and looked about him and gave a great sigh. "Why do you sigh?" said the fox. The monkey pointed to the tombs and  and replied, "All the monuments that you see here were put up in honor of my forefathers, who in their day were eminent men." The fox was speechless for a moment, but quickly recovering he said, "Oh! Don't stop at any lie, sir; you"re quite safe. I'm sure none of your ancestors will rise up and expose you."

Boasters brag most when they cannot be detected.

## 31. 狐狸和猴子

一只狐狸和一只猴子一起走在路上, 接着陷入一场有关谁出生更好的争论. 他们不停地争论一段时间, 直到他们走到了有路经过充满纪念碑的墓地的地方, 这时猴子停下来看了看狐狸, 发出一声长叹. "你为什么长叹", 狐狸说. 猴子指了指那些坟墓回复:"你看到的那些纪念碑都是纪念我的先祖, 他们活着的时候都是杰出的人.". 狐狸一时语塞, 但很快就清醒, 说:"哦! 谎言不要停, 先生, 你相当安全. 我确定你的先祖不会起身揭露你.".

吹牛者当他们不会被揭穿的时候吹嘘得最厉害.
