## 30. THE DOLPHINS, THE WHALES, AND THE SPRAT

The dolphins quarreled with the whales, and before very long they began fighting with one another. The battle was very fierce, and 
had lasted some time without andy sign of coming to an end, when a sprat thought that perhaps he could stop it; so he stepped in and 
tried to persuade them to give up fighting and make friends. But one of the dolphins said to him contemptuously, "We would rather go 
on fighting till we're all killed than be reconciled by a sprat like you!".

尝试说服他们放弃战斗并且和好. 但其中一只海豚轻蔑地对他说:"我们宁愿战斗至死也不愿被你这只鲱鱼调解".
